### **Kubernetes in Plain English**

![image]({{< usestatic "intro-k8/kubernetes2.png" >}})

**Containerization** is this trend thatâ€™s **taking over the world** to allow people to run all kinds of different applications in a variety of different environments. When they do that, they **need an orchestration solution** in order to keep track of all of those containers and schedule them and orchestrate them. **Kubernetes is an increasingly popular way to do that.**
